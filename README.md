# Tensorflow Retrieval Baseline
This repos leverages triplet-reid  https://github.com/VisualComputingInstitute/triplet-reid repos to create a baseline on retrieval datasets like CUB200, Cars196 and stanford online products. The repos evlauates multiple ranking losses like contrastive, angular, semi-hard and hard triplet loss, lifted struct loss, etc. I will update this repos by the end of May 2019.
